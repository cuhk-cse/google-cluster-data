README file for Google cluster data
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The dataset is released by Google in 2011, including traces of workloads running 
on Google compute cells. We analyze ClusterData2011_2, the most recent version 
of this dataset. It represents 29 day's worth of cell information from May 2011, 
on a cluster of about 11k machines.  

The total size of the compressed trace is approximately 41GB, which can be 
downloaded at:
